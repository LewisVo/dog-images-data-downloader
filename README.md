# Dog images data downloader 

This script is used to download photos for each dog breed found by [this scipt](https://github.com/VoLuong/dog-breed-scraper). In other words, it scrape images from Bing. These images are later used for training my tensorflow model. 

> I could have used Bing's official API but I have no money + credit card. 

Output 513 folder. Each folder is a dog breed with more than 30 images inside.
